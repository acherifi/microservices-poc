# Microservices architecture

Microproject on how to manage a Microservices architecture on separate servers.

## Explanation

This project is a tryout on how to:

- Develop an app with microservices in JS with Express
- Use vagrant to setup a ready-to-go development environment that can run the app.
- Use Ansible to provision the Vagrant VMs with the working app.
- Make an Ansible playbook to "deploy" the app in a "production environment".
- Use Traefik as a revers proxy to redirect requests to the corresponding services.

*The production environment will use the same Vagrant VMs but blank. The compiled code will be deployed after the VMs are started.*

## Architecture
